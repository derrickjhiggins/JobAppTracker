                    <img src="images/dna-output.png" alt="Output of a Python DNA Sampler" title="&copy; 2023 DJH SWE INC." />
                    <figcaption>This is the output of one of my first programs written in Python during Harvard's CS50 course. The program identifies a person based on matching sequences of nucleotides within their DNA as compared to a DNA database.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>Here is the string of DNA that was sampled and searched for nucleotide patterns.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/dna-database.png" alt="Database used to match DNA to nucleotide patterns" title="&copy; 2023 DJH SWE INC." />
                    <figcaption>This is the database of our (fictional) characters used to find DNA matches.</figcaption>

                    <img src="images/paris.jpg" alt="The Eiffel Tower" title="&copy; 2023 DJH SWE INC." />
                    <figcaption>No tourist photo collection is complete without a shot of the Eiffel Tower. <em>La vie est trop courte pour boire du mauvais vin.</em></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/iris.jpg" alt="A photo of my iris." title="&copy; 2023 DJH SWE INC." />
                    <figcaption>The iris sphincter muscle, also known as the pupillary sphincter or sphincter pupillae, is a muscle located in the colored part of the eye called the iris.</figcaption>

                    <img src="images/basilica.jpg" alt="The Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Paris" title="&copy; 2023 DJH SWE INC." />
                    <figcaption>Here is the lesser known counterpart to the Eiffel Tower: The Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Paris. Lesser known, but certainly not lesser in beauty.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/vatican.jpg" alt="The Vatican, Rome" title="&copy; 2023 DJH SWE INC." />
                    <figcaption>Can beauty be stolen? Roman imperialism on display in the Vatican seemed to suggest that it can, though historical experts may disagree.</figcaption>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/coldplay.jpg" alt="Coldplay Concert" title="&copy; 2023 DJH SWE INC." />
                    <figcaption>That's me singing on stage in front of 100,000+ people! Just kidding, that's Chris Martin of Coldplay, but I can always dream, right?</figcaption>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/sydney.jpg" alt="Sydney Opera House" title="&copy; 2023 DJH SWE INC." />
                    <figcaption>One of the more iconic musical structures in the world, the Sydney Opera House is surprisingly known for its visual aesthetic and not its acoustic excellence. That being said, I did enjoy the singular concert I attended there.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/yosemite.jpg" alt="Half Dome" title="&copy; 2023 DJH SWE INC." />
                    <figcaption>When we reached the top of Half Dome during our climb, I realized my water pouch had leaked. I had no water for the remainder of the climb down: over eight hours in 90+F degree weather. This is maybe the closest I have come to seeing hallucinations.</figcaption>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/golden-gate-bridge.jpg" alt="Golden Gate Bridge" title="&copy; 2023 DJH SWE INC." />
                    <figcaption>The Golden Gate Bridge is not made of gold, nor silicon for that matter. I once heard that the bridge is only gold in VR.</figcaption>

                    <img src="images/great-barrier-reef.jpg" alt="Great Barrier Reef" title="&copy; 2023 DJH SWE INC." />
                    <figcaption>The Great Barrier Reef is stunning. I hope everyone can experience it in some capacity during their lifetime, while preserving its integrity and working to keep our oceans clean. You can donate and help plant a coral to restore the reef <a href="https://give.barrierreef.org/donate/plant-a-coral-2023">here</a>.</figcaption>
